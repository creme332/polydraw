# polydraw ðŸ’Ž

A rasterized shape drawing application, inspired by GeoGebra Classic, developed as part of a UI design assignment. This application allows users to draw various rasterized shapes with a simple and intuitive interface, focusing on user experience and design principles. The project report, which details the design process and key decisions, is available [here](docs/report.pdf).
